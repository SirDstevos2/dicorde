# Extending discorder

Right now things are breaking left and right, and while you could use it as an alternative, I wouldn't recommend it. For that reason, documentation is also very sparse.

#### Getting started

If you look in the project's `main.go` file you can see that there's very little setup code before we call discorder.run.

Before this you can add your own commands, etc.

##### Custom commands
